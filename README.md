# mySIMBL

![Preview](preview.png)

mySIMBL is a plugin manager for macOS.

mySIMBL uses a modified version of SIMBL to load plugins into applications. With mySIMBL it is easy to find and update plugins to improve the user experience of macOS. This project was designed as a successor to the application EasySIMBL since both EasySIMBL and the original SIMBL no longer work properly on macOS 10.9 and above due to changes made by Apple. With both projects appearing to be abandoned or left unsupported I decided to create mySIMBL.
